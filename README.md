# RGB-LED-
RGB LED is an element that emits the three primary colors (Red, Green, and Blue) separately.
Thus, we can obtain any color we want by mixing these primary colors in particular ratios.
Using such kind of LED allows using a new technique in designing that the pixel in a common colorful matrix display consists of three separate LEDs (Red, Green, and Blue).
